# go-interpreter

This repository contains a Go implementation of an interpreter for the Monkey programming language, as described in the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## About

This project is a learning exercise, following the steps outlined in Thorsten Ball's book. It provides a functional interpreter for the Monkey language, covering topics such as:

* Lexing and parsing
* Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
* Evaluation and execution
* Environments and scopes

## Features

* **Monkey Language Support:** Implements the core features of the Monkey programming language.
* **Lexer and Parser:** Converts source code into an AST.
* **Evaluator:** Executes the AST and produces results.
* **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):** Interactive environment for executing Monkey code.
* **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages.
* **Following "Writing An Interpreter In Go":** Built directly from the instruction of the book.
